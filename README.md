## LTC's Etch a Sketch!

This project is a browser-based drawing application inspired by the classic toy Etch-a-Sketch. It allows users to create drawings by moving their cursor over a grid of boxes, changing their colors. The project was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The following features are available:

- **Grid Size Selection**: Users can choose the size of the drawing grid from three options: 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64.
- **Color Selection**: Users can select between two colors, black and white, to draw on the grid.
- **Drawing Interaction**: When the user hovers the cursor over a box in the grid, the box changes color based on the selected drawing color.
- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset the grid to the initial state by clicking on any of the grid size buttons.

How to use:

1. Choose the desired grid size by clicking on one of the grid size buttons (16x16, 32x32, or 64x64).
2. Select the preferred drawing color by clicking on the corresponding color button (Black or White).
3. Move the cursor over the grid boxes to draw. The boxes will change color based on the selected drawing color.
4. To reset the grid, click on any of the grid size buttons.
